Keeping this in mind, but hopefully rather less consequentially, distinguish in meaning between the Greek nouns νόμος (NO-mos) and νόσος (NO-sos).

That said, give any of the three more temperate phrases inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. 
ΓΝΩ͂ΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΌΝ / ΜΗΔῈΝ ἌΓΑΝ / ἘΓΓΎΑ ΠΆΡΑΔ'ἌΤΑ (Δ'ἌΤΗ) GNÓTHI SEAUTÓN / MEDÉN ÁGAN / ENGÚA PÁRA D'ÁTA (D'ÁTE) NOTE TO READER:  IF PLAYERS ASK, YES, THAT IS AN UNFORTUNATE RENDERING OF "IF YOU DON'T SWING, DON'T RING [THE DOORBELL]" INTO LATIN. 
B2:  Another less-famous Latin inscription I discovered while writing this question can be found above a plaza in Amsterdam, reading "homo sapiens non urinat in ventum". Apparently a "homo sapiens" doesn't check their sources, either, since "urinat"--if it's an extant form at all--means "dive". Fill in the two missing words from the more common and accurate version of this proverb:  Vir _________ non contra ventum ___________.
