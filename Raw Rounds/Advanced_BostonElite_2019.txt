Synthesibus dum gaudet eques dominusque senator 
 Dumque decent nostrum pillea sumpta Iovem; 
Nec timet aedilem moto spectare fritillo, 
 Cum videat gelidos tam prope verna lacus: 
Divitis alternas et pauperis accipe sortes: 
 Praemia convivae dent sua quisque suo. 
'Sunt apinae tricaeque et si quid vilius istis.' 
 Quis nescit? vel quis tam manifesta negat? 
Sed quid agam potius madidis, Saturne, diebus, 
 Quos tibi pro caelo filius ipse dedit? 
Vis scribam Thebas Troiamve malasve Mycenas?
