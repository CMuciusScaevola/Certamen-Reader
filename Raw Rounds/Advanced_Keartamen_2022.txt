Clamantibus amicis ut ad ipsos desiliret, ille rem ausus est incredibilem: in urbem hostium
praecipiti saltu semet inmisit, cum vix sperare posset dimicantem se moriturum esse; quippe,
antequam adsurgeret, vivus capi poterat. Sed ita saluit ut se pedibus exciperet; et, ne circumiri
posset, fortuna providerat. Vetusta arbor ramos velut de industria regem protegentes obiecerat.
Huius spatioso stipiti corpus adplicuit, clipeo tela excipiens. Nam cum tot manus unum peterent,
nemo tamen audebat propius accedere. Pugnabat pro rege desperatio, magnum ad honeste
moriendum incitamentum. Sed iam ingentem vim telorum exceperat, iam galeam saxa
perfregerant, iam gravata genua succiderant.

stipitem et suos ramos?
