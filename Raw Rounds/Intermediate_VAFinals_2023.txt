TOSSUP: Please listen to the following Latin passage, which I will read twice, and the  answer in English the question that follows:

Est mīrābile in regiōne Cinlipiuc [kin-LI-pi-uc]. Est ibi fōns; nōn fluit rīvus ex eō neque in eō. Vādunt hominēs piscārī ad fontem, aliī vādunt in fontem ad partem orientis et dēdūcunt piscēs ex eā parte, aliī ad dextram, aliī ad sinistram, ad occidentamque, et trahuntur piscēs ex eā parte. Et aliud genus piscium trahitur ex omnibus partibus. Magnum mīrābile piscēs invenīrī in fonte, dum nōn flūmen fluit in eō neque ex eō, et in eō inveniuntur quattuor genera piscium et nōn est dē magnitūdine neque dē profunditāte. Profunditās illīus fontis usque genua. (repeat)
