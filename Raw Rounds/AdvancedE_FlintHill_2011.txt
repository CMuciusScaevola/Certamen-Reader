18. TOSSUP: A certain Flint Hill grammarian included in a college application essay the  following statement: “I want to spend my days at Columbia in lucubration at Butler  Library, poring over Plato as I receive the quintessential classical education of a young  Roman scholar, but in the heart of New York City.” From what Latin noun with what  meaning is the English word “lucubration” derived?

Flint Hill Certamen 
19. TOSSUP: Everyone knows that Woojin Kim is smart, attractive, musically gifted,  seventeen, debonair, Pyrrhus, cute, Asian, hilarious, and “supabeast.” But he has one  nagging weakness: girls.
