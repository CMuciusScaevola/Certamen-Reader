# Certamen-Reader
Single-player Certamen question reader with questions from local and national level tournaments

Relevant files for playing are in the folder Reading Files

"Search question bank" button allows searching for exact term matches within all questions. Can use boolean searches with and & or as well as searching by level.

Report faulty question saves the question to a faulty questions file, but I have to fix them manually. Faulty questions are those with incorrect information or those that have been incorrectly parsed (e.g. a part of the answerline is shown with the question itself), not challengable questions/questions with incorrect information.

Once answer is submitted, the correct answer will be displayed; the reader does not grade answers.

Keybindings:

Read next question/bonus: "n"

Skip current question (only works whilst reading, not after answering): "s"

Buzz: spacebar

Submit answer: enter


I apologize that the code isn't very clean, I'll be documenting it gradually
